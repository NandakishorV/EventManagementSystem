# Event Management System

#### Problem Statement 
Every student eagerly looks forward to any upcoming events conducted by colleges or schools such as tech fests, culturals, symposiums, hackathons, etc. They get to enjoy such wonderful events due to the work that is done by the hosting party and the admins behind it. But sometimes, hosting and managing an event can be stupendous and a hassle. The admins need to manage each sub-event and the participants manually, which is very ineffective. The information about the event is also not very apparent. Further, human errors can affect the certification process. Hence, the flow of the event can be scabrous at times. This leads to an underwhelming experience for the students, but this can be tackled by a centralized event management system.

The project is aimed at developing an online event management system that is of importance to any institute to host an event. The Event Management System (EVM) is an Internet-based application that helps users to book their preferred event in online mode. Meanwhile, the admins would be able to host and manage the events effectively and efficiently. This system can be used to automate the workflow of ticket purchase, ticket generation, and eventÂ organization.
